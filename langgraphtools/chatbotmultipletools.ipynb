       "AIMessage(content='\\n<think>\\nOkay, so I need to figure out what the capital of India is. Let me start by recalling any information I have about India\\'s geography and politics. I know India is a big country in South Asia, and like many countries, it has a capital city where the government is based. But wait, I might be mixing up some details here. Let me think step by step.\\n\\nFirst, India\\'s government is a federal parliamentary democratic republic, right? That usually means there\\'s a capital city where the President, Prime Minister, and the Parliament are located. Now, what cities in India come to mind? Major cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Kolkata... Hmm, Mumbai was the capital before? Wait, I think there was a change. I remember hearing that the capital was shifted from Mumbai to somewhere else a long time ago. \\n\\nWait, Mumbai is in Maharashtra, but Delhi is a separate union territory. Delhi is a major city, but is it the capital? I think so. Let me verify. I recall that New Delhi is a part of Delhi, and it\\'s often mentioned as the capital. But sometimes people refer to the entire National Capital Territory as Delhi. So maybe the capital is New Delhi, but it\\'s within Delhi. \\n\\nWait, let me make sure not to confuse the National Capital Territory of Delhi with the city of New Delhi. New Delhi is actually a smaller area within Delhi that serves as the capital. So the capital city is New Delhi, but it\\'s part of the larger Delhi region. \\n\\nBut sometimes people just say Delhi as the capital. Maybe both are correct, but technically New Delhi is the official capital? Let me check my memory for any historical context. I think India gained independence in 1947, and before that, the British colonial capital was Calcutta (now Kolkata). But after independence, they moved the capital. Wait, was it moved to Delhi then? \\n\\nYes, I think the capital was shifted from Kolkata to Delhi post-independence. So Delhi became the capital. But why the confusion between Delhi and New Delhi? Because New Delhi is a distinct area within Delhi that was built by the British to serve as the seat of government. So the government buildings, like the Parliament, the President\\'s residence, and foreign embassies, are located in New Delhi. \\n\\nTherefore, while Delhi is the broader metropolitan area and the union territory, the actual capital is New Delhi. However, when people ask for the capital city, they might refer to Delhi as a whole. But to be precise, the answer should be New Delhi. Wait, let me think again. Maybe the official capital is just called Delhi, but the city is named New Delhi? Or is New Delhi a part of the capital area? \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the capital is simply referred to as New Delhi. Let me think of examples. When I see news articles, they often say the Indian government is in New Delhi, not just Delhi. So perhaps the official capital is New Delhi. However, in common usage, people might just say Delhi. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the National Capital Territory of Delhi is the administrative division, and within that, the capital city is New Delhi. So the answer is New Delhi. \\n\\nWait, but sometimes sources just say Delhi. Let me try to recall any official sources. The Government of India\\'s official website or any reliable source. For instance, the Parliament of India is located in New Delhi. The President\\'s residence (Rashtrapati Bhavan) is in New Delhi. So the administrative capital is New Delhi. Therefore, the correct answer is New Delhi. \\n\\nBut I need to be careful here. Let me also consider that some countries have their capital named as the larger city, even if the government is in a part of it. For example, Washington, D.C. is the capital of the U.S., not just Washington state or D.C. Similarly, here, New Delhi is the capital within the Delhi NCR (National Capital Region). \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the capital is referred to as Delhi, with New Delhi being a part of it. Let me check my knowledge again. The capital of India is New Delhi. Yes, that\\'s what I remember from school. So the answer should be New Delhi. \\n\\nWait, but sometimes in quizzes or general knowledge questions, they might accept Delhi as the answer. But the exact name is New Delhi. Hmm. Let me think if there\\'s any other possibility. \\n\\nAlternatively, could it be Mumbai? No, Mumbai was the capital under the British rule before 1911, but later the capital was moved to Delhi. Before that, Kolkata was the capital. So after independence, Delhi remained the capital. \\n\\nAnother angle: the current Prime Minister\\'s office is in New Delhi. The India Gate, the Parliament, and all the major government buildings are in New Delhi. So yes, the capital is New Delhi. Therefore, the correct answer is New Delhi. But maybe the user just expects \"Delhi\" as the answer. Let me confirm once more. \\n\\nLooking up in my mind, the official capital is New Delhi. But in common usage, people might say Delhi. However, the question is straightforward: \"What is the capital of India?\" The standard answer is New Delhi. But wait, maybe the official name is just Delhi? Let me think of international references. For example, the United Nations list of capitals would have New Delhi as the capital of India. \\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the country\\'s capital is officially Delhi, with New Delhi being a district within it. The National Capital Territory of Delhi includes New Delhi as its capital district. But when asked the capital city, it\\'s usually referred to as New Delhi. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is simply Delhi? Hmm, conflicting thoughts here. Let me think of the Indian government\\'s own sources. The Government of India\\'s official website probably says New Delhi as the capital. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the confusion comes from the fact that the national capital territory is called Delhi, and within it, the capital is New Delhi. So the answer depends on how specific the question is. Since the question is simply \"What is the capital of India?\", the answer is New Delhi. \\n\\nWait, but I might be overcomplicating. Let me recall school textbooks. In my school days, the capital was taught as New Delhi. However, sometimes it\\'s referred to as Delhi in common parlance. \\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps both are acceptable, but the correct, official name is New Delhi. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the user expects the answer as Delhi, but to be precise, it\\'s New Delhi. Let me verify through another angle. The seat of the Government of India is in New Delhi. The Supreme Court is there, the President\\'s residence, etc. So yes, the capital is New Delhi. \\n\\nTherefore, I should answer New Delhi. \\n\\nBut let me think again. Let me recall the official designation. According to the Constitution of India, the national capital is called the National Capital Territory of Delhi, but the capital city is New Delhi. \\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is Delhi, and New Delhi is a part of it. Let me think of other countries. For instance, the capital of the United States is Washington, D.C., not just Washington. So similar to that, the capital is New Delhi, part of Delhi. \\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer is New Delhi. However, sometimes it\\'s commonly referred to as Delhi. But since the question is straightforward, I should go with New Delhi as the official capital. \\n\\nWait, actually, checking my memory again, I think the correct answer is New Delhi. However, let me check if there was any recent change? No, I don\\'t think so. \\n\\nWait a second, the capital of India is New Delhi. Yes, that\\'s right. So the answer should be New Delhi.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of India is **New Delhi**. \\n\\nTo provide more detail:  \\n- **New Delhi** is a distinct area within the larger National Capital Territory of Delhi.  \\n- It serves as the seat of India\\'s government, housing key institutions such as the Parliament of India, the Rashtrapati Bhavan (President\\'s residence), and the Supreme Court.  \\n- While \"Delhi\" refers to the broader metropolitan region, \"New Delhi\" is the official capital city.  \\n\\nThus, the correct answer is **New Delhi**.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1713, 'prompt_tokens': 17, 'total_tokens': 1730, 'completion_time': 4.227697717, 'prompt_time': 0.003605221, 'queue_time': 0.7229793259999999, 'total_time': 4.231302938}, 'model_name': 'qwen-qwq-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_07cd5d759a', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-af3c75f4-45de-4501-87a8-5d9b54e935e4-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 17, 'output_tokens': 1713, 'total_tokens': 1730})"
